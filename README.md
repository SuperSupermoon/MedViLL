Our proposed architecture MedViLL is a single BERT-based model that learns unified contextualized vision-language (VL) representation for both Vision Language Understanding (VLU) and Vision Language Generation (VLG). MedViLL performs pre-training with a CNN-based visual encoder and a cross-modal Transformer for VL joint representation learning. After pre-training, our model can be easily used for VLU and VLG tasks with task-specific finetuning. Please refer to our paper "[**Multi-modal Understanding and Generation for Medical Images and Text via Vision-Language Pre-Training**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11333)" for more details.

 
## 1) Downloads.
### Pre-trained weights.
We provide five versions of BERT-based pre-trained weights with different types of self-attention masks. Pre-training for the joint embedding was built on the BERT-base architecutre(12 hidden layers, 12 attention heads, 768 hidden size), and training details are described in our paper. Currently avaliable versions of pre-trained weights are as follows:
 
- [MedViLL](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1shOQrOWbkIeUUsQN48fEP6wj0e266jOb/view?usp=sharing) - BERT-Base model with Bidirectional Auto-regressive attention mask.

- [Bi & Seq2Seq](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hn8DLgPkblIew_UEP3TwoLwKZw03Pkmk/view?usp=sharing) - BERT-Base model with Seq2Seq attention mask(75%) and Bidirectional attention mask(25%) in every mini-batch.

- [Bidirectional](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GSb-CjUnfuTTDrb0tPEwHGo1Qg1JHvdf/view?usp=sharing) - BERT-Base model with Bidirectional attention mask.

- [Seq2Seq](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O76qXkRkP-yS5iChwpH-8Z5EWDLbkWuu/view?usp=sharing) - BERT-Base model with Seq2Seq attention mask.

- [Non-cross](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZEu0NioO6ThJC_pWRYByyJ4-XwMnGvJA/view?usp=sharing) - BERT-Base model with Non-cross modality attention mask.


### Datasets.
We provide a pre-processed version of multiple datasets for each task as follows:
 
 Download each dataset to the path /data/[dataset].

## 2) Reproduce.
### Section A. Installation
Sections below describe the virtual env installation and the fine-training process of MedviLL based on pytorch version 1.7, python version 3.8. 
To fine-tune MedViLL, you need to download the pre-trained weights of MedViLL. After downloading the pre-trained weights, use medvill.yaml to install conda based virtual env as follows:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SuperSupermoon/MedViLL.git
$ cd MedViLL; conda env create --file medvill.yaml
```

Note that all fine-tuning models were conducted on 8 Geforce RTX-3090 GPU machines, each of which has 24GB of VRAM. 

### Section B. Prepare pre-processed dataset

Unzip mimic, openi, and VQA-RAD tar.gz files. 

```
$ cd MedViLL; tar -zxvf [file_name.tar.gz]
```

```
$ cd MedViLL
$ python main.py
